# varroa-linkage-map

This project aims to construct a linkage map of Varroa destructor genome.
We used genomes of 223 varroa mite samples, belonging to 30 families, of 3 colonies.
Each mite family consists of 3 generations, and contain at least:
- foundress female mite
- son and daughter
- at least one grandkid (son/daughter)

All mites were collected at the experimental apiary of OIST (Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology) 

The repository contains antyhing that is required for you to re-run the analysis.
However, the original input fastaq files are too large to be uploaded to the Github repository, therfore, prior to runing the pipline you need to download them to your cluster. 
you can do it from [here](__link to the NCBI with fastq files_)
