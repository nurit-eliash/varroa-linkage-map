#varroa-linkage-map

This project aims to construct a linkage map of Varroa destructor genome.
We used genomes of 223 varroa mite samples, belonging to 30 families, of 3 colonies.
Each mite family consists of 3 generations, and contain at least:
- foundress female mite
- son and daughter
- at least one grandkid (son/daughter)

All mites were collected at the experimental apiary of OIST (Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology)
